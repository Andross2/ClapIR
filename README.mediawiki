ClapIR is a tool for measuring the acoustic properties of a
room. Simply start the app and clap your hands. ClapIR then analyzes
the clap's recording to calculate the room's reverberation times and
frequency response. It's acoustics engineering made easy!

ClapIR is based on research done at Northwestern University by
[http://prem.seeth.org Prem Seetharaman] and [http://stevetarzia.com
Stephen Tarzia], with additional support from [http://pdinda.org
Prof. Peter Dinda].  For details on the research, please read the
